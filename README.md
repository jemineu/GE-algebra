# GE-algebra


This code was produced to accomplish our research and make it easier to find some results, such as find all GE-subalgebras, filters, composition series, Hilbert algebra axioms, and many of other methods defined as below, note that after every method there is a comment to show the role of it.  First of all, we should fill a "*.csv" table file with the GE-algebra Cayley table, or fill it with "nan" for an empty product result which will be computed to reach GE-algebra axioms.
To make it faster to complete computed GE-algebra, you can fill the diagonal, first row, and first column by the next axioms which is stated in Bandaru, Saeid, and Jun (On GE-algebra) research, as follows:
1) x*x=1
2) 1*x=x
3) x*1=1
