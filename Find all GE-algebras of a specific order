First of all, you should edit the main code to satisfy your set.
Secondly, as an example of finding those of order 3, we got used the following code after editing the main code to let Y have 3 elements,
and editing the "*.csv" file, then after running the code file, we use the following code as follows:


for x,y in product(Y,Y):
	t[2][3]=x
	t[3][2]=y
	if gex.ge(Y)==True:
		print(t)
